# 🏥 Medical RAG Chatbot using Gemini, LangChain & Pinecone

An AI-powered Medical Chatbot that leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to answer user queries based on trusted medical documents. Instead of relying solely on an LLM's internal knowledge, the chatbot retrieves relevant information from a medical PDF stored in a vector database and uses Google Gemini to generate accurate, context-aware responses.

---

# 📌 Problem Statement

Medical information is often stored in lengthy PDF documents, making it difficult for users to quickly locate relevant information.

Traditional chatbots either:
- Depend on predefined responses, limiting flexibility.
- Answer solely from an LLM's general knowledge, which may produce hallucinations or inaccurate medical information.

The objective of this project is to build an intelligent medical assistant that retrieves relevant information from trusted medical documents before generating responses, improving accuracy and helping reduce the likelihood of hallucinations by supplying retrieved medical context to the LLM before response generation.

# 💡 Solution

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using LangChain, Pinecone, and Google Gemini.

Instead of directly asking the LLM to answer a question:

1. Medical PDFs are loaded and divided into smaller chunks.
2. Each chunk is converted into vector embeddings.
3. Embeddings are stored in Pinecone Vector Database.
4. When a user asks a question, semantic similarity search retrieves the most relevant chunks.
5. The retrieved context and user question are passed to Google Gemini.
6. Gemini generates a context-aware response based only on the retrieved information.

This approach significantly improves response reliability compared to a standalone LLM.

↓

### Step 2
Split the document into manageable text chunks.

↓

### Step 3
Generate embeddings for every chunk using Hugging Face Sentence Transformers.

↓

### Step 4
Store embeddings in Pinecone Vector Database.

↓

### Step 5
User asks a medical question.

↓

### Step 6
Retrieve the most relevant chunks using semantic search.

↓

### Step 7
Combine the retrieved context with the user question.

↓

### Step 8
Generate a context-aware response using Google Gemini.

# 📈 Business Impact

Traditional keyword search requires users to manually browse lengthy medical documents to locate relevant information.

This chatbot improves information retrieval by:

- Providing semantic search instead of keyword matching.
- Reducing the time required to find medical information.
- Generating context-aware responses grounded in trusted documents.
- Minimizing hallucinations by retrieving relevant context before response generation.
- Providing a scalable architecture that can be extended to healthcare, legal, HR, finance, and enterprise knowledge bases.
